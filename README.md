Hi, I'm Ibrahim Moawad

Computer Engineer with experience in the hearing-aid industry, specializing in embedded systems, digital signal processing, and 3D-printed manufacturing workflows. I focus on building efficient, scalable tooling for custom-fit hearing devices, from CAD automation to production-ready pipelines.

I enjoy designing engineering solutions that merge hardware, software, and manufacturing processes to improve product quality and user experience.
